# Farm-Management-System | IoT Project - README

## Introduction

This project is an Internet of Things (IoT) application developed during my third year of college. The primary focus of this project is to leverage IoT technology to create a practical and innovative solution that addresses a real-world problem or provides value to users. In this README, I will provide an overview of the project, its objectives, features, and how to use or deploy it.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Farm-Management-System

**Author:** Shubham Prabhat

**Date:** June'2019

**College:** KIIT University | Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology

**Year:** 2016-2020

## Objective

Technology Used: Dashboard(ThinksBoard), Python, IoT, Prezi

The project deals with tracking the location of trees/plantation areas, locating them on Google Maps, creating a database with geospatial references, and providing their present condition like soil water level, air humidity, soil moisture, and temperature in the surrounding. which will save plants from getting undernourished and eventually death.

- Monitoring and controlling devices remotely.
- Collecting and analyzing sensor data for various applications.
- Building a practical IoT solution to solve a real-world problem.
- Exploring the potential of IoT in a particular domain (e.g., home automation, agriculture, healthcare, etc.).

## Features

List the key features of your IoT project. This will give the readers a quick overview of what your project can do. For example:

- **Remote Monitoring:** The project allows users to monitor and control devices remotely via a web or mobile application.

- **Sensor Integration:** Utilizes various sensors to collect data such as temperature, humidity, light levels, or any relevant parameters, which can be accessed and analyzed.

- **Data Visualization:** Provides data visualization through graphs, charts, or dashboards to help users understand the data trends.

- **Alerts and Notifications:** Set up custom alerts and notifications based on predefined conditions, ensuring users are informed of important events.

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access to the IoT system.

- **Expandable and Customizable:** The project is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of more devices and sensors to fit different use cases.
